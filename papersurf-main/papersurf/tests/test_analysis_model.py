# Unit test to ensure the Analysis class initialises with the correct semantic model.
#
# This test creates an instance of the Analysis class and verifies that its `model` attribute
# is set to "all-MiniLM-L6-v2", which is the expected default model for semantic similarity operations.
#
# It helps catch issues such as incorrect model loading or unintended changes to the default configuration.
#
