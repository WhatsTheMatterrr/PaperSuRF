# Unit test to ensure all command strings in the CommandLineInterface map to valid, callable functions.
#
# This test instantiates the CommandLineInterface and iterates through its `commands` dictionary,
# asserting that each command maps to a callable function or method. It helps catch issues like
# undefined or incorrectly assigned handlers.
