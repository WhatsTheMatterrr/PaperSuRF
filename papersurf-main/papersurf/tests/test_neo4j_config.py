# Unit test to verify that the Neo4j database configuration in the `settings` module is correct.
#
# This test compares the values of `DATABASE_URI`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
# from the `settings` configuration with known expected constants. It ensures that the application
# is connecting to the correct database endpoint with the appropriate credentials.
#
# This helps catch misconfigurations early, especially in deployment or environment setup.
